# 🏔️ Research Frontier: CODE-GEO V2.0

**Project:** cosmic-latency
**Status:** Open Problem / Theoretical Boundary
**Issue:** The BAO-Sound Horizon Conflict ($)

## 1. Problem Definition: The 28-Sigma Tension

While the **Latency Field ($\phi$)** successfully resolves the $ Tension (7.4$ vs 3.2$), it introduces a secondary, deeper conflict. By increasing the informational latency at high redshift, the model naturally inflates the **Comoving Sound Horizon** ($) by $\approx 8.5\%$.

* **Predicted $:** $\approx 159.5$ Mpc
* **Observed $ (DESI/BAO 2026):** 47.09 \pm 0.3$ Mpc
* **Discrepancy:** $\approx 28\sigma$ (Catastrophic without shielding).

## 2. Current Mitigation (The V1.1 "Shield")

In the current stable release (V1.1), we implement a **Fine-Tuned Sound-Speed Coupling**:
21943 c_s^{\text{eff}} = \frac{c_s}{\mathcal{F}(z)} 21943
This manually cancels the $ inflation. However, as documented in , this coupling is currently **unprotected by symmetry** and appears fine-tuned to fit the 2026 BAO baseline.

## 3. The Three Paths to CODE-GEO V2.0

### **Path A: Scale-Dependent Holography (Recommended)**

Instead of a universal latency $\mathcal{F}(z)$, we implement a **Scale-Dependent Kernel** $\mathcal{F}(z, k)$.

* **Super-Horizon ( < aH$):** Latency is active, shifting the background expansion rate (z)$.
* **Sub-Horizon ( > aH$):** Latency is suppressed, leaving the sound horizon $ (a sub-horizon ruler) untouched.
* **Benefit:** No fine-tuning required; horizon crossing is a parameter-free physical trigger.

### **Path B: Angular Diameter Decoupling**

Shift the focus from (z)$ to the **Lensing Potential**. If the "Overclocking" effect modifies the angular diameter distance $ rather than the expansion rate, the observed $\theta_s = r_s/d_A$ is preserved without modifying $.

* **Challenge:** Requires a non-minimal coupling to the Weyl tensor.

### **Path C: The Wyler-SO(3,2) Embedding**

Return to the root of the trilogy (**Pillar I**) and embed the Latency Field into the (3,2)$ conformal geometry. This would derive both the $ shift and the $ preservation from a single geometric identity.

## 4. Summary of Failure Modes

A theory is only as good as its falsification conditions. CODE-GEO V1.1 is currently "under stress" at:

1. **The BAO Ruler:** If $ is measured at /usr/bin/bash.1\%$ precision without a $ shift, Path A becomes mandatory.
2. **Phantom Crossing:** If  < -1$ is detected, the Latency Field $ is fundamentally ruled out.
